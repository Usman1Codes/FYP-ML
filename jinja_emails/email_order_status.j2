I have checked our records for **Order #{{ data.order_id }}**, and here is the latest update:

*   **Current Status:** {{ data.status }}
{% if data.delivery_date %}
*   **Expected Delivery:** {{ data.delivery_date }}
{% endif %}

{% if data.tracking_link %}
You can track your package in real-time here: [Track My Order]({{ data.tracking_link }})
{% endif %}

If you have any other questions about your shipment, please don't hesitate to ask.
{% elif state == 'not_found' %}
I searched our system for **Order #{{ data.order_id }}**, but unfortunately, I was unable to locate a record with that specific number.

Could you please double-check the Order ID? It typically starts with **#** or **ORD-** (e.g., #12345).

If you can provide the correct number or the email address used for the purchase, I will be happy to look it up again for you.
