I attempted to look up your information, but the data provided seems to be in an unrecognized format.

**Issue:** Invalid {{ data.field_name }} format.

To help me find your records, please ensure:
*   **Order IDs** start with **#** or **ORD-** (e.g., #12345).
*   **Email Addresses** are in the standard format (e.g., name@example.com).

Could you please double-check and reply with the correct information?
