This past Friday, around 10:30 AM, I logged into my account on your website, went to 'Tax Documents,' and saw a list of available documents. I clicked on the 'Download 1099-K (2022)' link. The link seemed to process for a moment, but then nothing happened. No PDF downloaded, and no new tab opened. I tried clicking the 'Download PDF' link for the 2021 document as well, and the exact same thing occurred. I checked my browser's download settings, and there were no blockers or pop-up warnings. I tried right-clicking the link and selecting 'Save Link As,' but that also failed to initiate a download. It's as if the PDF files aren't actually linked or are inaccessible. This was on my laptop using Firefox.",

I logged into my account on your website, navigated to 'Privacy Settings,' and found a toggle labeled 'Public Profile Visibility.' It was currently set to 'Public.' I clicked the toggle to switch it to 'Private.' The page refreshed, and for a moment, it looked like the setting changed. However, when I navigated to my public profile page (by opening it in an incognito window), it was still accessible. Then, when I went back to 'Privacy Settings,' the 'Public Profile Visibility' toggle had reverted to 'Public.' My change wasn't saved, and there was no error message. This was on my desktop using Edge.",

I went to my shopping cart on your website, located the item, and saw a quantity selector. It was set to '2.' I clicked the '-' button to reduce it to '1.' The page refreshed, and for a moment, it showed '1,' but then it immediately reverted to '2.' There was no error message. I tried manually typing '1' into the quantity box and pressing Enter, but the same thing happened; it reverted to '2.' I also tried removing the item entirely and re-adding it with a quantity of '1,' but it still somehow ended up as '2' in the cart. It seems the quantity adjustment isn't working for this specific item. This was on my laptop using Chrome.",

This past Saturday, around 2:00 PM, I navigated to the 'Headphones' category, and on the left sidebar, I saw filters. I selected 'Sony' under 'Brand' and 'Black' under 'Color.' The page refreshed, but instead of showing filtered results, it displayed 'No products found matching your criteria.' This was confusing, as I know for a fact you sell black Sony wireless headphones. I tried selecting only the 'Sony' filter, and that worked, showing all Sony headphones. But as soon as I added the 'Black' color filter, it returned 'No products found.' It seems the combination of filters is causing an issue, even when relevant products exist. This was on my desktop using Firefox.",

I added items to my cart, proceeded to checkout, and entered the code 'GET15OFF' into the 'Coupon Code' field. I clicked 'Apply.' The page refreshed, and a red banner appeared at the top saying 'Invalid coupon code.' I double-checked the code from my email, making sure there were no typos, and it was exactly 'GET15OFF.' The email stated it was valid until the end of the month. I tried typing it in manually, just in case copying and pasting introduced invisible characters, but the result was the same: 'Invalid coupon code.' My cart total remained unchanged.

I went to your game's support forum, navigated to the 'Bug Reports' section, and clicked 'New Topic.' I filled in the subject, a detailed description of the bug, and the steps to reproduce it, including screenshots. After completing the form, I clicked 'Submit Topic.' The page processed for a few seconds, then displayed a red error message at the top of the page: 'Failed to create topic. You do not have permission.' This was confusing because I'm a paying subscriber and have posted on the forum before. I tried logging out and logging back in, but the same permission error appeared, preventing me from submitting the bug report. This was on my desktop using Chrome.",

This past Thursday, around 2:30 PM, I logged into my account on your website, went to the 'Rewards Store,' and found the accessory I wanted. It cost 1000 points. I clicked 'Redeem,' and a confirmation pop-up appeared asking 'Are you sure you want to redeem 1000 points for this item?' I clicked 'Confirm.' The pop-up closed, and the page refreshed. However, instead of showing a confirmation that the item was redeemed or added to my cart, the 'Redeem' button for that item was still active, and my point balance remained unchanged. There was no error message. I tried again, but the same thing happened. It seems the point redemption isn't processing. This was on my desktop using Firefox.",
